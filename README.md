#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room Client asked for a singleton game application that can be served on multiple OS and web based. The game allowed for users to create teams, join teams, create their user, and join games. This game application was completed in Java. 

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What I did particularly well in this document was research and analysis of my options. I was able to analyze the information and research I had gathered then give a comprehensive analysis. 

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I was able to refer back to the document numerous times to give myself a reminder of the end results and tasks. I was also able to ensure I didn't miss any requirements during the development. 

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose the executive summary to revise. I think I could make it a bit more clear and understanding for those that may be as technical in speak or understanding. 

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I was able to understand the users needs by placing myself in their shoes and thinking how they would like to see this designed. I frequently would double check my work and their requirements to ensure I didn't miss anything. It's important to consider the user's needs because you don't want to waste yours and the clients time if you deliver a product that isn't what they requested. 

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approach designing software by reading or gathering their requirements and then creating UML diagrams of the system. From the created diagrams I can focus on the components and how they will interact, what they will contain, and their methods. I would use a similar design plan in the future for other software applications. This allows me to organize my thoughts and ensure I don't miss anything.
